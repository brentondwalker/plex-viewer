OpenGL Rendering
================

To run the examples use one of the following:

./run_amd64.sh -complex rips_simplices.txt -points rips_points.txt

./run_x86.sh -complex rips_simplices.txt -points rips_points.txt

The commands to manipulate the image are as follows:

arrow keys	-	rotates the object
page up/down	-	zoom in/out
numpad 8/2	-	increase/decrease filtration parameter
space bar	-	capture screen output to file

(Changes to the filtration parameter may not be visible at first;
zoom in and keep increasing the value until you see changes.)

=============
Pov Rendering
=============

To do Pov rendering, you need 'povray' installed: http://www.povray.org/

Run the following commands:

./generate_pov.sh -complex ./rips_simplices.txt -points ./rips_points.txt -destination out.pov
./render_default.sh out.pov 

This should create a file called out.png
